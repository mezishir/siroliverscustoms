    <h1>Welcome to Sir Oliver's Customs</h1>
    <p>This site is currently undergoing construction. Please excuse our dust as we work to perfect our site for you.</p>


<p>Sir Oliver is passionate about art and creating works of art based on others' ideas. The main focus at Sir Oliver's Customs is on tabletop miniatures for tabletop rpg games like Warhammer, Battletech, and DND, but custom orders are not limited to these items. At this time custom orders are currently closed as we work to get the shop in order. Please bear with us as we work to get the shop up and running properly. Please feel free to explore the site.</p>
