      <h1>Welcome to Sir Oliver's Customs</h1>
      <p>This site is currently undergoing construction. Please excuse our dust as we work to perfect our site for you.</p>
      <p>Sir Oliver is passionate about art and creating works of art based on others' ideas. The main focus at Sir Oliver's Customs is on tabletop miniatures for tabletop rpg games like Warhammer, Battletech, and DND, but custom orders are not limited to these items. At this time custom orders are currently closed as we work to get the shop in order. Please bear with us as we work to get the shop up and running properly. Please feel free to explore the site.</p>

      <h5>Faux Stained Glass</h5>
      <p>What is faux stained glass? It is an acrylic paint that can be safely used on glass to create the look of stained glass without the matching price tag. It is easily removed from the glass and can be stored flat in Ziploc bags, if necessary, and reused.

        Have you ever used the window clings during the holidays?
        
        Imagine having something like that, but it is exactly the way you want it, unique to you and your style.
        
        Also, you're not limited to holidays.</p>
        <p>Faux stained glass is a great way to add color and beauty to glass, whether it is a storm door or a window. It can create abstract light, just as stained glass can, or offer privacy.</p>
        <p>It is created using a water-based paint that is non-toxic. Each creation is permanent until removed. Be warned, however, that the paint does not like heat. Doors and windows that are susceptible to full sun will cause fading and melting of the artwork and are not advisable for faux stained glass.</p>
