      <h1>Welcome to Sir Oliver's Customs</h1>
      <p>This site is currently undergoing construction. Please excuse our dust as we work to perfect our site for you.</p>
      <p>Sir Oliver is passionate about art and creating works of art based on others' ideas. The main focus at Sir Oliver's Customs is on tabletop miniatures for tabletop rpg games like Warhammer, Battletech, and DND, but custom orders are not limited to these items. At this time custom orders are currently closed as we work to get the shop in order. Please bear with us as we work to get the shop up and running properly. Please feel free to explore the site.</p>

      <h5>Tabletop Miniatures</h5>
      <p>The items shown here are custom orders that have been completed by Sir Oliver's Customs.</p>
      <p>This was a custom order. A model of Sigvald from Age of Sigmar was used to create the customer's original character. It is used as a demon lord while playing Warhammer 40K on the tabletop.</p>
      <p>This model of Ghazghkull Thrakka was painted as a gift for someone else. The design was based off of Games Workshop's paint scheme from their official website with a few custom touches, such as the blood splatter on the claws and the Ultramarine symbol on the ruins on the base of the model.</p>
      <p>This is a set of Battletech miniatures that were custom painted for a customer. Each detail on the models are hand painted. There are no decals used. The bases are custom as well, giving the models the appearance of standing on terrain.</p>
      <p>This is a model of Mortarion painted for fun because someone told the artist he was difficult to paint.</p>
      <p>Someone told the artist the Elementals from Battletech are difficult to paint. Nearly, immpossible, they said, because of how tiny they are.<br>

        She put war paint and runes on the Elementals.<br>
        
        For fun.<br>
        
        To prove she could do it.<br>
        
        Please stop telling the artist things are difficult to paint.</p>
